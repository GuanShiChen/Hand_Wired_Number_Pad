## Wiring Overview

- Diodes are placed on the **row side**, with the **cathode (marked side)** facing the row wire  
- Each switch is connected to a **row and a column wire** to form a matrix  
- Wires are soldered directly to switch terminals and routed to the Pro Micro pins

## Firmware Setup (QMK)

### QMK Setup

1. **Clone the QMK repository:**

        git clone https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware.git
        cd qmk_firmware
        qmk setup

2. **Create a new keyboard layout:**

        qmk new-keyboard

3. **Follow the prompts and create your directory under:**

       keyboards/handwired/numpad

4. **Customize the following files:**

    * `info.json`
    * `keymap.c`

    <br>

    *Sample code can be found in the `/Code/` directory


### Build & Flash

    qmk compile -kb handwired/numpad -km default
    qmk flash -kb handwired/numpad -km default


*Make sure your Pro Micro is in **bootloader mode** (double tap reset) when flashing.

## 3D Printed Case and Plate

* CAD and STL files are located in the `/CAD/` directory
* Designed in **Autodesk Inventor**

**Print Settings:**

* Printer: Bambu Lab P1S
* Layer Height: `0.2mm`
* Infill: `20â€“30%`
* Supports: **Yes** (for screw holes)
